## Validation Issues

### Issue 1: NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker present

**Location**: FR-017
**Issue**: "Page MUST render correctly pixel-perfectly according to Figma design specifications [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Figma design file URL or location not provided - please provide link to Figma design]"
**Severity**: High - Blocks implementation
**Resolution Required**: User must provide Figma design file URL or location

## Notes

- Specification is otherwise complete and ready for planning
- One clarification marker remains regarding Figma design file location
- This clarification is critical as the entire feature depends on pixel-perfect Figma implementation (Constitution Principle II)
- Once Figma link is provided, specification will be complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
